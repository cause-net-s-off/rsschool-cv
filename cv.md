### Java Script code example: 
*Calculating the sum of all elements of an array 'without limiting' their values. *
*I solved this task by representing the numbers as a strings*
```javascript
const sum = (arr) => {
        if (arr.length == 0) { return 0}
        arr.sort((a, b) => b - a)
        let maxElementLength = String(arr[0]).length
        let total = ''
        let acum = 0
        for (i = 0; i < maxElementLength; i++){
            arr.forEach((element, index) => {
                digit = String(element).slice(String(element).length - 1 - i, String(element).length - i)
                if (digit === '') {arr[index] = ''}
                acum += Number(digit)
            });
            total = String(acum % 10) + total
            acum = Math.trunc(acum / 10)
        }
        if (acum > 0) {total = String(acum) + total}
        return total
    }
```
